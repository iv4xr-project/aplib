Details:
- "build":				the subdirectories of this one will be filled only when a build or test target is used.
- "build/archives": 	this directory will be filled only when a build target is used in ant,
						if the target is the build via ikvm the sub directory "net" will be also created.
						Note: since other projects dependes on 2p, in the tags folder in the repository you will find
						2p.jar and tuprolog.jar inside this directory.
- "release":		in this directory, if the target "11.release.bin" is used, will be created the package of 2p 
						ready to be distributed in two forms: folder and zip file.
						The package contains the binaries of 2p (2p.jar and tuprolog.jar), the javadoc, the guide and 
						the results of tests (unit and acceptance).
