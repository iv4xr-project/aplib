to use it:

Command is:
> python3 threeDheatmap.py <gamename> <csv-file>

game name is either MD or SE. Level size is hard coded in the script, you can change those


> python threeDheatmap.py MD //heat map//visits-2mazes-type1-h1-0 targeted.csv



will save the result in something like bla.png, but you can change this of course.
It hardcodes the level size to 20x20 and 2-mazes
