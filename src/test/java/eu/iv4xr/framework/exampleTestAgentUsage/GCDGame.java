/**
 * A simple game as an example of "Program under Test". This class implements a
 * game called GCD-game. The game is played on an imaginary 2D grid space. The
 * game maintains three variebles/fields: (x,y,gcd). The fields x,y represent
 * the current position of the player in the 2D grid. Any non-negative x,y are
 * valid. The greatest common divisor of these x and y is stored in the field
 * gcd. The player can move up, down, left or right, one square at at time. The
 * player wins if he/she manage to find a square whose greatest common divisor
 * is 1 (in other words, if x and y are relative prime to each other).
