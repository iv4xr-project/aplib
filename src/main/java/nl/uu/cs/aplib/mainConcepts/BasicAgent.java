/**
 * This is the root class of all agents in aplib. As the name suggests, this
 * class provides you with basic but working agents. An instance of BasicAgent
 * is an agent. You can give it a goal (to be more precise, an instance of
 * {@link GoalStructure}. Assuming a strategy has been supplied along with the
 * goal, you can then execute the agent, which in turn will execute the strategy
 * towards solving the goal. A BasicAgent uses a very simplistic
 * <i>deliberation</i> scheme. When in the current state (of the agent) the
 * given strategy leads to multiple possible actions ({@link Action}) to choose,
 * the agent's internal process to decide which one to choose is called
 * <b>deliberation</b>. A BasicAgent simply chooses randomly. A BasicAgent is
 * suitable to be used as a so-called <b>subservient</b> agent. In particular,
 * it lacks the ability to run as an autonomous agent. It also lacks the ability
 * to exchange messages with other agents. If you need autonomous and
 * communicating agents, you can use a subclass called
 * {@link nl.uu.cs.aplib.agents.AutonomousBasicAgent}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * After creating a blank agent using the constructor, you will need to attach a
 * state to it. This may sound contradictory to you. Since we are in Java, the
 * just created agent would be an object, and it would have some methods. This
 * object already has a state, composed of the values of its fields; so the
 * statement of 'attaching' a state would be wierd. It is true that any instance
 * of BasicAgent will come with its own fields etc that form its state. However
 * this state would have no information about the domain of the goal that you
 * try to solve with the agent. For example if you want the agent to play the
 * Monopoly game, its built-in state would have no knowledge of how a the
 * Monopoly board looks like. Without this knowledge we can't expect it to be
 * able to play Monopoly. You would first need to provide a representation of
 * this board as a subclass of {@link SimpleState} and then attach an instance
 * of this board to your agent so that it can use it to at least track the state
 * of the game. Use the method {@link #attachState(SimpleState)} to attach a
 * state. After this, the agent is ready to do work for you.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Use the method {@link #setGoal(GoalStructure)} to give a goal to a
 * BasicAgent. It is assumed, that when you provide a goal, you also attach a
 * {@link Tactic} to it that the agent can use to solve the goal. To execute
 * this strategy you can invoke the method {@link #update()}, which will execute
 * the strategy for a single tick. Call the method repeatedly until the goal is
 * solved, or until the agent exhaust the computation budget that you may have
 * specified for the goal:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   while (topgoal.getStatus().inProgress()) {
 *      agent.update();
 *      ... // do whatever else between agent's updates
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Between calls to {@code update()} the agent will not do anything (though the
 * {@link Environment} on which it operates might do a lot of things). Each call
 * to {@code update()} is also called a <b>tick</b>. The above way of running an
 * agent puts you in full control of when to give a tick to the agent, hence
 * invoking its behavior. An agent that is used in this way is called
 * <i>subservient</i>, as opposed to autonomous agents that control the ticking
 * themselves. Autonomous agents would run on their own threads, whereas a
 * subservient agent can stay in the same thread is your main thread. See
 * {@link nl.uu.cs.aplib.agents.AutonomousBasicAgent} for a base class to create
 * autonomous agents.
