/**
 * Contains examples of suggested goals and tactics that developers can
 * implement. They are typically offered in terms of Interface. So, there are no
 * concrete implementation of them. Note that the implementation can be expected
 * to be pretty domain-specific, so offering a general implementation is quite
 * impossible.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The package does offer general goal-solving algorithms built on these
 * interfaces. So, if the interfaces are implemented the algorithm can be used
 * to solved certain kinds of goals.
